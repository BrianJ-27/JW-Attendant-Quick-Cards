   <h2>1: General Guidelines (All Attendants)</h2>
   <p>Quick-action protocols for immediate response.</p>
  </header>
  <section>
   <h3>Demeanor &amp; Timing:</h3>
   <p>Be warm, friendly, and kind to all attendees (Col. 4:6). Be at your assigned post <strong>30 minutes</strong> before the meeting starts.</p>
   <h3>Violent Individual Protocol:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Spotting: If a real threat is seen and confirmed, the Auditorium Attendant calls 911 immediately.</li>
    <li>Lock &amp; Barricade: Secure all doors immediately to prevent entry.</li>
    <li>Alert: The Auditorium Attendant alerts the congregation of the risk.</li>
    <li>Evacuate: If the hall is not surrounded, direct attendees away from the violence.</li>
    <li>Subdue: If an attacker enters, multiple brothers work together to subdue them.</li>
    <li>Shelter: If trapped, hide in a locked room, block the door quietly, and stay out of sight.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Medical Emergencies:</h3>
   <p>Immediately inform another brother and go to the scene, requesting assistance from any medical professionals present. Ensure 911 is called by the auditorium attendant if needed; the speaker may be advised to pause the program.</p>
   <h3>Disruptions:</h3>
   <p>If a disruptive person refuses to leave, state: <strong>“Your implied invitation has been rescinded”</strong> and call the police.</p>
   <h3>Sheltering:</h3>
   <p>These shelter-in-place steps also apply to civil disturbances, severe weather, or environmental emergencies.</p>
